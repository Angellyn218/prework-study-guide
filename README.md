# Pre-work Study guide

## Description
My motivation for creating this project was to practice the skills that I learned through the pre-work for the UC Berkeley Coding Extension Program. Additionally, I also hoped to document what I learned on the website in the form of a study guide that I can return to. With the help of this project, I was able to relearn the skills needed to create a website.

## Usage
This can be used by both me and future students as a study guide to help learn, relearn, or remember different aspects of web developement that are important to remember when creating websites. The notes are there for review. If the student is unsure of what to study, they can open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows).This will provide the student with a list of topics and allow them to get a random suggestion of which topic to start with.
